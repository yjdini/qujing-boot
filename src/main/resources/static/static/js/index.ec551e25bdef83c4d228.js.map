   <p>「取经」的目的其实很简单。</p>\n    <p><br /></p>\n    <p>我在大学期间听过的讲座屈指可数，我觉得台上的人很不容易，首先他不可能了解台下人的状况，其次他有很多话不能当太多人的面说，甚至连粗口都不方便爆，最后只能讲成功方面的事情。听多了就感觉没意思了。而且听他讲完之后，想加个微信都很困难。</p>\n    <p><br /></p>\n    <p>我还尝试了很多次线下一对一的交谈，找了很多朋友要某个人的微信号，然后请他出来喝咖啡，闲聊一会儿就结束了，也没有个明确的主题，最后可能还要欠下人情债。想想也是，本来就占用了别人的时间，为什么还要臆想别人有认真帮助你的义务呢。</p>\n    <p><br /></p>\n    <p>感觉我已经很久没体验过“有用”的经验交谈了。这并不是一个好现象，我们应该去解决它。</p>\n
